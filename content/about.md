Dealing with various kinds of complexity is one of my key duties as an Industrial Engineer. Reducing it often has the highest return on investment. That is why I usually strive to find clean, simple, and sustainable solutions to problems and to life in general.

**I’m a curious student of life.** If I’m not improving my skills or knowledge of the world on a regular basis I get bored. When I don’t understand, I ask why, and set out to find an answer.

**I'm an adaptive teamplayer.** My intercultural work experience helps me to fit into different kinds of working environments and teams fast. I like to contribute with my knowledge and grow together as a team.

**I'm a quick learner, with a hands-on mentality.** My degree enables me to quickly grasp complex and sometimes abstract concepts. Applying the theory towards real-world problems and getting my hands dirty is one of my ongoing goals.

**I’m open-minded.** I despise prejudices against people. Alternative views to my own are fascinating, not threatening.

**I’m an extroverted introvert.** While I love meeting new people and exploring new places, I recharge my energy at home.  

**I've got a T-shaped education profile.** My bachelor's studies gave me broad and solid fundamentals in the fields of mathematics, statistics, applied informatics, and business management. The fundamentals were followed by a specialization in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Network Theory during my master's.
