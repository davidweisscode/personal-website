Dealing with complexity is one of my key duties as an Industrial Engineer. Reducing it often has the highest return on investment. That is why I strive to find clean, simple, and sustainable solutions to challenges and to life in general.

**I’m a curious student of life.** If I’m not improving my skills or knowledge of the world on a regular basis, I get bored. When I don’t understand, I ask why, and set out to find an answer.

**I'm an adaptive teamplayer.** My full-time work experience teached me to fit into different working environments and teams fast (~1 year in Germany, 6 months in Singapore). I enjoy knowledge exchange among colleagues and growing together as a team.

**I'm a quick learner, with a hands-on mentality.** My degree enables me to quickly grasp complex and abstract concepts. For applying the theory to real-world challenges, I also have the necessary technical skills to implement my ideas.

**I’m open-minded.** I despise prejudices against people. Alternative views to my own are fascinating, not threatening.

**I’m an extroverted introvert.** While I love meeting new people and exploring new places, I recharge my energy at home.  

**I've got a T-shaped education profile.** During my bachelor's I enjoyed broad and solid fundamentals in mathematics, informatics, engineering and business management. A specialization in Data Science and Network Analysis followed in my master's.


### Timeline

**1993:** I was born in Karlsruhe, Germany.

**2010:** I wrote my first lines of code at my school's computer science work group.

**2012:** Finishing school and starting university, I met lots of cool people and was part of a very cooperative body of students. Within my first year at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, I attended two courses about programming in Java.

**2014:** During my internship at EclipseSource, I ventured further into the world of software development. I got into JavaScript and learned about cross-platform mobile apps, while practicing my skills at the command line, version control, and test-driven development.

**2015:** My second internship at Bosch allowed me to experience a more business oriented side of my study programme. I quickly took over responsibility in a ratio project and sharpened communication and project management skills.

**2016:** Following the internship, I got into the joint research project of "ParKing" between KIT and Bosch on crowdsourcing data about on-street parking areas. As a front-end mobile developer and UX designer, I was part of a Scrum team working remotely and with agile methods.

**2017:** Realize to venture further for Data Science due to Service Analytics.

**2018:** My personal highlight, working abroad in Singapore.

**2019:** Recommender Systems teaching assistant

**2019:** Data is the new oil. Value by analyzing, but more insights by linking data. Realize to focus more on networks and linked data.

**2020:** Finishing my master's with a thesis about Knowledge Graphs and linked data analysis.
