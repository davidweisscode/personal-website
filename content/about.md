**Dealing with complexity** is one of my key duties as an Industrial Engineer. Reducing it often has the highest return on investment. That is why I strive to find clean, simple, and sustainable solutions to challenges and to life in general.

**I’m a curious student of life.** If I’m not improving my skills or knowledge of the world on a regular basis, I get bored. When I don’t understand, I ask why, and set out to find an answer.

**I'm an adaptive teamplayer.** My full-time work experience teached me to fit into different working environments and teams fast (~1 year in Germany, 6 months in Singapore). I enjoy knowledge exchange among colleagues and growing together as a team.

**I'm a quick learner, with a hands-on mentality.** My degree enables me to quickly grasp complex and abstract concepts. For applying the theory to real-world challenges, I also have the necessary technical skills to implement my ideas.

**I’m open-minded.** I despise prejudices against people. Alternative views to my own are fascinating, not threatening.

**I’m an extroverted introvert.** While I love meeting new people and exploring new places, I recharge my energy at home.  

**I've got a T-shaped education profile.** During my bachelor's I enjoyed broad and solid fundamentals in mathematics, informatics, engineering and business management. A specialization in Data Science and Network Analysis followed in my master's.


### Timeline

**1993:** I was born in Karlsruhe, Germany.

**2010:** I wrote my first lines of code at my school's computer science work group.

**2012:** Finishing school and starting university. Within my first year at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, I attended two courses about programming in Java.

**2014:** For my first internship I decided to work within the industry of software development. At EclipseSource, I got into JavaScript and learned about cross-platform mobile apps, while practicing my skills at the command line, version control, and test-driven development.

**2015:** My second internship at Bosch allowed me to experience a more business oriented side of my study programme. I quickly took over responsibility in a ratio project and sharpened communication and project management skills.

**2016:** Following the internship, I got into the joint research project of "ParKing" between KIT and Bosch on crowdsourcing data about on-street parking areas. As a front-end mobile developer and UX designer, I was part of a remote Scrum team working with agile methods.

**2017:** During the excellent class about "Service Analytics" hosted by KSRI@KIT I realized that I'd like to venture further into the world of Data Science.

**2018:** This one is my personal highlight: I had the great opportunity to live and work in Singapore for seven months. At Bosch Siemens Home Appliances I was part of an awesome, intercultural, and interdisciplinary team working in the field of IoT and digital transformation. I could expand my understanding of south-east asian culture and generally about living in a vast foreign metropolis. I made lots of new friends by joining a local dragon boat club and pushed myself to new limits by paddling and working out.

**2019:** As a teaching assistant for KIT's chair of electronic markets I was responsible for the Recommender Systems exercise class. I taught several machine learning algorithms, such as clustering, decision trees, and rule mining, for a class of about 80 master students.

**2020:** Data is the new oil running our world. However, as raw oil needs refinement, so does data. By carefully analyzing and linking data we can ultimately extract knowledge. That is why I finished my master's with a thesis about Knowledge Graphs and linked data quality.
