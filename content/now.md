Currently, I'm **interviewing for entry-level positions** in the fields of Data Science and Data Engineering. I still live close to Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, though considering moving to other great cities.

I’m healthy and happy, despite the COVID-19 situation. The last month has been spent mostly at home. But I’m grateful to have chosen a path where I’m only **dependent on a computer, an internet connection, and a (possibly remote) team of colleagues**.

The last few days I worked on **updating this website**. My main goal was to enable a clean navigation and build a compact, yet beautiful design to share some insights about myself. I also made some layout changes to support mobile devices and implemented dark mode.

**I enjoy my freetime** by tinkering on side projects, playing tennis outdoors for as long as autumn allows and studying Beethoven piano sonatas and Chopin waltzes.
