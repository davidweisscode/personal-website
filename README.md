Source code for my personal website

---

I use (Hugo)[https://gohugo.io/] as my static site generator.

* Start a development server with live reload (Disable cache with browser DevTools open)
```
hugo server
```
* Build the website
```
hugo
```
* Copy contents of the `public` folder to your webhost
```
cp -r public/* ../davidweisscode.github.io/
```
